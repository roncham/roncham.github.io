&lt;p&gt;A lifetime ago when I was around 13 I went camping with the boy scouts. We camped at Wolverine Canyon (S.E. Idaho) which was about 45 minutes from town.
We got to camp around 7pm and some us started setting up the tent. Others gathered firewood and a couple guys gathered rocks for a fire ring and kindling to build a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cooked our dinners over the fire. Everything from tin foil dinners, steaks skewered on a stick and hotdogs. Each scout brought there own dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally settled down around 10pm and went to sleep. Now, 10 teen age boys can be loud so the scoutmaster, Mr. Combs slept about 100 feet away in his own 2-man pup tent. The rest of us slept in an old military nine man bell tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About an hour later there was a loud explosion! Followed by another… and another…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ** With each explosion we could hear things hitting the tent. A total of 7 explosions. One guy from our tent started to go outside, but we stopped him and told him to stay in his sleeping bag. The scout master was also yelling not to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally after of about 20 minutes of silence we heard the scout master rustling around outside asking if everyone was ok. He told us to stay in the tent all night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we could see the tent was covered with small rocks and slivers of rocks. The heavy canvas tent protected us well. If anyone had ventured out they could have been hurt pretty badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 guys gathering rocks had grabbed rocks from the creek. That whole canyon is shale and sandstone. Sandstone is very porous and full of air pockets. As the fire coals heated the air pockets and water that had seeped into the rocks it expanded and the rocks literally blew up!&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever spent hours trying to figure out a problem and after you walk away from it or you just give up trying to solve it, then the solution just comes to you?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you try to remember a persons name for a long time then suddenly in the middle of the night the names pops into your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively working on the problem for hours on end will not help you solve it. Your brain is too active and too easily distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best solution for solving a problem or just being more productive is to just &lt;strong&gt;walk away and quiet your mind&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time every day and just do nothing. Here are a few ways to let your mind wander while you relax and a few things to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a walk outside&lt;/strong&gt; – preferably in a park or in a nature setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try meditation&lt;/strong&gt; – meditation comes in many forms, but the point here is too just empty your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Tai Chi&lt;/strong&gt; – this ancient Chinese mind-body practice is perfect for relaxing. Also referred to as “meditation in motion”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoga&lt;/strong&gt; – an ancient Hindu mind-body practice, helps to reduce stress and helps you become calm and centered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do deep breathing exercises&lt;/strong&gt; – Breathing deeply helps you calm down and feel more relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a massage&lt;/strong&gt; – There is nothing like a great massage to relax. If money is tight, some massage schools let students work on clients at a discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to a nature sounds CD&lt;/strong&gt; while closing your eyes and relaxing, doing yoga or meditating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind cannot relax and come up with solutions if you are keeping it busy doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the television&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the radio or loud music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do whatever it takes to help you to relax your mind and you will increase your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you relax your mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
