I am a co-founder of PegasusTeam.com</p>\n<p>I started designing websites in 1996 using html from scratch. I have been working with WordPress for over a decade. Building and tweaking sites for myself, individuals, businesses and organizations. This site is my first venture into using <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby</a> to build a website/blog.</p>\n<p>My wife and I have both been involved in Internet Marketing in one form or another since we first got computers in the mid 90′s. Although we followed the usual path of making money online by joining hundreds of programs and being disappointed, we have pretty much learned our lessons and now focus on other things.</p>\n<p>I first met my wife online around 1999. We had a long distance relationship and formed PegasusTeam and worked together online for 4 years before we finally made the plunge and got married. We both relocated to Las Vegas and just recently to her home on the Big Island of Hawaii where we were enjoying our life and business ventures together! We recentely moved back to Vegas.</p>\n<p>I love the outdoors and if there was wifi on top of the mountain, that’s where you would find me.</p>\n<p>I am also a published author.
